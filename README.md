I) Selecting this Topic
Initially recognized in 2019 as causing a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the SARS Corona Virus 2, or CoVid-19, has reached pandemic levels of infection. Also simply called the coronavirus, this disease caused by Covid-19 has reached all continents aside from Antartica. This virus has mutated numerous times since its discovery. These mutations must be monitored, as they can lead to a greater lethality as well as improved transmission in an environment. 

Following the phylogeny, or the history of genetic code, we can see how unique offshoots have made it to different localities. This should be seen under the lense of movements of people & allows us to understand the path of contagion. The applications of this knowledge is useful for containment & prevention of transmission. 

Finally, viral genetic surveillance will be useful in the development of therapies & vaccines. As many of us in the midst of this global health crisis are aware of, vaccine development can take months to perfect. During this time the virus will thus have undergone changes which must be tracked to ensure quality of final product.


II) Intent of Analysis
Examining the data we have available on the virus's genetic codes we hope to find the rate at which this virus mutates, as well as the likelihood of a documented infection having a particular origin. Understanding these elements will help us foresee the potential of future mutations and reflect on its path.


III) Data Used
The National Center for Biotechnology Information has created a public data hub that catalogues genomic sequencing of the virus. This hub has accumulated over 250 sequences from 21 countries.


IV) Our Data at a Glance
Within California, 9 sequences are recorded. Different locality's viral sequences will bare greater resemblance to the sequences of their origins. As such, South American viral DNA is more likely to have originated from Europe, while much of the United States' is more likely to come from Asia.
