i What data have you gathered, and how did you gather it?
The National Center for Biotechnology Informatioon (NCBI) houses online a genetic bank of DNA sequences. 
NCBI's genBank accrues the gentic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 as they are submitted.
These records include sequences as well as geolocation and a protein transcription.
To compare the likenesses of two genetic strains, NCBI also provides BLAST, or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.
Using BLAST provides data tables, each sequence having a percentage "aligned" with the reference strain, in this case the origin.    

ii How have you explored the data and what insights have you gained as a result?


iii Will you be able to answer your question with this data, or do you need to gather more data (or adjust your question)?


iv What modeling approach are you using to answer your question?


v extra steps needed
Pandas will need to be used to combine the BLAST alignment data frame with the geolocation, which is in the sequencing data.
